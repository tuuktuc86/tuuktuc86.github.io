Hello! I am **YeChan Lee**, currently pursuing a Master's degree in **Electrical and Electronic Engineering** at **KAIST**. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from **Chonnam National University** (summa cum laude). My research interests include **Artificial Intelligence, Reinforcement Learning, Motion Planning, and Robotics**.

<!-- Iâ€™m passionate about building intelligent systems and exploring cutting-edge technologies that integrate AI with real-world applications. During my undergraduate years, I participated in various competitions, hackathons, and entrepreneurship programs, receiving numerous awards. In my free time, I enjoy mentoring students and sharing knowledge about AI and engineering.

Feel free to explore my [publications page](/publications/) to see some of my recent work. You can also check out my social media links below. -->
